MageSuite 7.0.0 bumps up theme-creativeshop to v11.0.0 introducing compatibility with Magento 2.4.1+

Following breaking changes were introduced in v11.0.0 of theme-creativeshop:

- Adds support for native Magento In Store Pickup introduced in Magento 2.4.0+. 
Since this theme-creativeshop version it is no longer possible to use hack method to install development In Store Pickup modules along with Magento 2.3.0. 
We use that approach in some of our projects and thus we had to release breaking compatibility version to ensure our projects on Magento 2.3 can still be maintained using theme-creativeshop v10.
